## 🌍 CSC 202 – Assignment 1: Modeling and Projecting the Earth's Surface

### Overview

In this assignment, we’re building a system to **rank and analyze regular slices of the Earth’s surface**. Your job is to design the data structures, create example data, and implement functions that help reason about climate-related changes over time.

Your work will be organized into **four tasks**.

You must use:
- `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for all your data definitions  
- **External functions only** (no class methods)  
- **Recursive functions** for list processing  
- **Correct type hinting** for all functions and data structures  


---

## ⚠️ Important Setup Step Before You Begin

If you are using **GitHub Codespaces**, make sure to run the following command in the terminal **before you start coding**:

```bash
git pull --no-rebase
```

This ensures you have the most up-to-date files from the starter repository before making any edits.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Define the Data Classes

Define **three immutable data classes** using `@dataclass(frozen=True)`. These will model the basic geographic and environmental information about regions on Earth.

---

### `GlobeRect`

Represents a rectangular region of the globe. It should contain the following attributes:

- `lo_lat`: the lower latitude in degrees 
- `hi_lat`: the upper latitude in degrees 
- `west_long`: the western longitude in degrees
- `east_long`: the eastern longitude in degrees

> Note: `west_long` may be greater than `east_long` for regions crossing the international date line.

---

### `Region`

Describes the identity and terrain of a region. It should contain:

- `rect`: a `GlobeRect` object describing the physical boundaries
- `name`: a string with the name of the region (e.g., `"Tokyo"`)
- `terrain`: a string representing the terrain type — one of:
  - `"ocean"`
  - `"mountains"`
  - `"forest"`
  - `"other"`

---

### `RegionCondition`

Describes the current state of a region in a specific year. It should include:

- `region`: a `Region` object
- `year`: the year of observation (as an integer)
- `pop`: the population in that year (as an integer)
- `ghg_rate`: the greenhouse gas emissions for that year (as a float, in tons of CO₂-equivalent per year)

---

## ✅ Task 2: Create Example Data

Create **four instances** of `RegionCondition`. These will be used to test your functions in later tasks.

Store them in a list called:

```python
region_conditions = [...]
```

Your list must include:
1. A major metropolitan area from anywhere in the world
2. A second major metro from a different continent
3. A substantial ocean region (not a whole ocean)
4. A region that includes Cal Poly, but excludes:
   - San Jose
   - Santa Barbara
   - Bakersfield
   - and too much ocean

> Use rough estimates. Approximate within:
> - ~5% for latitude/longitude  
> - Factor of 10 for population or emissions  
> Don’t spend more than 5–10 minutes researching numbers.

---

## ✅ Task 3: Implement External Functions (with Design Recipe)

You must implement **external functions only** (do not define any methods inside the classes).  
Functions that process lists **must be recursive**.

### 🧪 Before you write any function logic:
For each function below, you must:
1. **Write your tests first** in a file called `test_student.py`
2. Write at least **1 test per function**
  - For example: self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=4)
4. Confirm your test(s) pass before continuing
   

> Your code will be evaluated using **hidden test cases**, so feel confident that your implementation handles **edge cases, invalid input, and boundary conditions**.

---

### 🔹 Subtask 3.1: `emissions_per_capita(rc)`

Takes a `RegionCondition` and returns the tons of CO₂-equivalent **emitted per person** in the region per year. Avoid division by zero — return `0.0` if population is zero.

---

### 🔹 Subtask 3.2: `area(gr)`

Takes a `GlobeRect` and returns the estimated **surface area of the region in square kilometers**.

#### ✅ Use a spherical Earth model

Instead of treating the region as a flat rectangle, use the formula for computing the area of a region on a **sphere**:

`A = R^2 * |λ₂ - λ₁| * |sin(φ₂) - sin(φ₁)|`


Where:
- `R = 6378.1` (Earth’s radius in kilometers)
- `λ₁`, `λ₂` = west and east longitude (in **radians**)
- `φ₁`, `φ₂` = low and high latitude (in **radians**)

This correctly accounts for:
- The curvature of the Earth
- Distortions near the poles
- The narrowing of longitude bands at high latitudes

---

#### 🌍 Handling longitude wraparound (crossing the 180° line)

If your rectangle crosses from one side of the Earth to the other (e.g. west_long = 170°, east_long = -170°), the longitude difference would be negative unless corrected.

Normally, to find how wide a region is in longitude, you subtract the west longitude from the east longitude:

`A = R^2 * |λ₂ - λ₁| * |sin(φ₂) - sin(φ₁)|`


This works most of the time.

But if your region crosses the 180° line — the line where longitude jumps from +180° back to -180° — then the subtraction gives you a **negative number**, even though the region does exist and has width.

For example:

- A region goes from 170° east to -170° (which is the same as 190° east if you went around the Earth).
- Subtracting:`-170° - 170° = -340°`
, which doesn’t make sense for width.

So we fix it:  
If the result is negative, it means we wrapped around the back side of the globe.  
We add a full circle (360° or \(2*pi\) radians) to turn that negative into the correct positive value.

This adjustment makes sure the computed width always represents the **shortest, correct path going east**, even across the date line.

---

### 🔹 Subtask 3.3: `emissions_per_square_km(rc)`

Takes a `RegionCondition` and returns the **tons of CO₂-equivalent per square kilometer**.

> Hint: Use the `area` function.

---

### 🔹 Subtask 3.4: `densest(rc_list)`

Takes a list of `RegionCondition` values and returns the **name** of the region with the highest population density, calculated as:

```
population / area
```

> This function must be **recursive**.  
> Do not use `max`, `for`, `while`, or list comprehensions.

---

## ✅ Task 4: Simulate Future Projections

Now we’ll simulate how regions change over time based on terrain-specific population growth.

### 🧪 Before you write any logic:
Follow the same process as Task 3:
1. Write at least one test in `test_student.py`
2. Use your test case to guide your implementation

---

### 🔹 Subtask 4.1: `project_condition(rc, years)`

Takes a `RegionCondition` and a number of years.  
Returns a **new `RegionCondition`** representing the projected state of the region after the given number of years.

#### Rules:
- Population updates annually based on the terrain type’s growth rate  
- Apply the growth rate once per year, compounding over time  
- Emissions scale proportionally with the updated population  
- The region and terrain stay the same  
- The `year` field increases by `years`

| Terrain     | Annual Growth Rate |
|-------------|--------------------|
| `"ocean"`     | +0.0001           |
| `"mountains"` | +0.0005           |
| `"forest"`    | -0.00001          |
| `"other"`     | +0.0003           |

> You are encouraged to define **helper functions** for population growth, emissions scaling, etc.  
> Do **not mutate** the original `RegionCondition` — return a new one.


---

## 🔧 Setup and Restrictions

Use the following imports only:

```python
import sys
import unittest
import math
from typing import *
from dataclasses import dataclass

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)
```

You must:
- Use **recursion** for all list processing
- Avoid all loops and comprehensions
- Write **all behavior as external functions** — no class methods
- Use **correct type hinting** throughout your code  
  > ✅ *We recommend using a VS Code extension like* `Pylance` *or* `Pyright` *to check type hints and catch errors early*
- Follow the **design recipe**:
  1. Purpose statement  
  2. Type comment  
  3. One or more examples/tests  
  4. Function definition

---

## 📤 Handin Instructions

You must commit and push the following files to your GitHub Classroom repository:

- `proj1.py` – your main implementation file  
- `test_student.py` – your test suite with at least one test per function  

A file called `test_1.py` is included to check that:
- Function names match
- Argument counts and return types are correct

  Sure! Here's a clean and clear bullet-point section in Markdown that you can paste directly into your assignment README or GitHub Classroom instructions:

### 🧪 Grading and Submission Policy

- ✅ Your **grade will be based on 20 hidden test cases**, each worth **5 points**, totaling **100 points**.
- 🧠 These test cases cover:
  - Data definitions (`GlobeRect`, `Region`, `RegionCondition`)
  - All required functions
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Handling of invalid or unexpected input
- ⚠️ **Passing `test_1.py` does not contribute to your grade**. It only checks basic setup and types.
- 📄 You must write your own tests in a file named **`test_student.py`**.
  - Failure to include `test_student.py` will result in a **10% penalty** on your final score.
- 📤 Late submissions reduce the **maximum possible grade by 10% per day**.
  - Even being late by a few minutes triggers this penalty.
  - For example:
    - 1 day late → max possible score = 90%
    - 2 days late → max possible score = 80%
    - etc.

---


### ✅ Reminder:
- Do **not edit** `test_1.py`
- Ensure both `proj1.py` and `test_student.py` are committed and pushed
- Push your code to GitHub — verify your changes appear on the GitHub website
- You won't see a green check mark, look at the action workflow auto-grader output.
